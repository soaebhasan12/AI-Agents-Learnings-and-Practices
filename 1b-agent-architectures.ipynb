The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-17T16:47:12.711016Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-17T16:47:12.711472Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-17T16:47:12.718944Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-17T16:47:12.711438Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-17T16:47:12.717664Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

While his attunement to the sea is established, giving him a brief internal thought or memory related to *why* he's solitary, or what he yearns for, could make his discovery more impactful. Is he looking for something? Escaping something?\n2.  **Sensory Details of the Map:** The phosphorescent ink and glowing 'X' are excellent starting points. To heighten the mystery, describe the *feel* of the parchment beyond \"brittle with age\" and \"strangely warm.\" Does it have an unusual texture? A faint scent? What do the islands and currents look like beyond just being \"uncharted\"? Are there strange symbols or formations?\n3.  **Foreshadowing the \"Hum\":** The lighthouse humming is a nice touch of the uncanny. You could subtly foreshadow this earlier by describing Elias's familiarity with the lighthouse's sounds. Perhaps he notices a new, deeper resonance in its usual creaks and groans *before* he finds the map, making the hum feel like a confirmation or a response rather than a sudden event.\nRefinerAgent > The salty spray kissed Elias’s weathered face as he climbed the spiral stairs, the lamp already a comforting beacon against the encroaching dusk. Tonight, the sea whispered secrets, and Elias, in his solitude, felt more attuned than ever. He often found himself lost in memories out here, the rhythmic crash of waves a constant reminder of the life he’d left behind, a life he’d sought to escape, though the exact reasons now felt as foggy as the pre-dawn sea. He’d chosen this isolation, this quiet vigilance, but sometimes, in the deep hours, a hollow ache for connection would surface.\n\nHe was polishing the Fresnel lens, its multifaceted surface a dazzling eye in the fading light, when a glint caught his eye. It was nestled amongst the discarded ropes and sea-worn buoys in the keeper’s quarters. A faint scent, like dried kelp and ancient sea salt, drew him closer. It was a rolled parchment, brittle with age, but strangely warm to the touch, its surface feeling like cured leather, smooth yet textured. Unfurling it, Elias gasped.\n\nLines of shimmering, phosphorescent ink pulsed across the vellum, forming not a nautical chart he recognized, but a swirling, dreamlike constellation of islands. Some depicted serpentine coastlines with jagged peaks that seemed to writhe, while others were mere dots surrounded by currents that flowed in impossible, spiraling patterns. Strange, indecipherable symbols were etched along the borders. A single, glowing 'X', radiating a soft, cerulean light, marked a spot far out in the uncharted western sea.\n\nAs he traced the luminous lines with a trembling finger, Elias felt a deep vibration thrum through the stone floor beneath his feet. It was a resonance he knew intimately, the lighthouse’s familiar groans and sighs, but tonight it was different—deeper, more resonant, as if the tower itself was awakening. It seemed to hum a low, anticipatory note, a response to the map’s silent, luminous call.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
